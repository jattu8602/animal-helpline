Automatic detection of freshness and ripeness in fruits and vegetables has evolved into a major research focus due to rising concerns about food safety, increasing food waste, and the urgent need for quality assurance in global supply chains. Fruits and vegetables are highly perishable commodities whose quality deteriorates rapidly due to biochemical reactions, microbial activity, moisture loss, and improper storage conditions. Traditionally, consumers and vendors have relied on manual inspection methods such as observing colour, checking firmness, or noticing Odor to assess freshness. However, these human-centred approaches are subjective, non-standardized, and prone to inconsistencies. In response, computer vision and machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for developing automated, objective, and scalable systems for freshness detection.

Early research efforts primarily relied on classical image-processing techniques and traditional
machine-learning algorithms. Researchers extracted hand-crafted features such as colour
histograms, texture descriptors (e.g., GLCM, LBP), shape and morphological attributes, edge
patterns, and surface irregularities. These features were then fed into machine-learning classifiers
like Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, Naïve
Bayes, and Logistic Regression for sorting fruits and vegetables into different quality categories.
Although these techniques achieved acceptable results under controlled conditions, they suffered
from significant limitations when applied in uncontrolled, real-world environments. Variations in
illumination, camera distance, background clutter, orientation, and natural variability within fruit
varieties often resulted in inconsistent outputs. In particular, traditional feature-based methods
struggled to detect subtle, early-stage spoilage indicators such as minor bruises, slight texture
changes, or small fungal growth. This lack of robustness created a need for more flexible and
adaptive systems.

The introduction of deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
significantly transformed the field by enabling computers to automatically learn hierarchical
visual features without manual feature engineering. CNNs excel at capturing complex patterns such as colour gradients, texture irregularities, shine variations, and structural deformities, which are critical cues for freshness or spoilage detection. With the availability of transfer learning models such as VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet, researchers began leveraging pre-trained architectures trained on large-scale datasets (like ImageNet) to analyse fruit and vegetable images. These pre-trained models provided rich feature representations that greatly reduced the amount of required training data and improved generalization across different environments. As a result, deep-learning-based freshness detection systems consistently outperformed classical models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

A major development in recent literature is the shift from simple binary classification (fresh vs.
rotten) toward more nuanced multi-class grading systems. Many researchers classify produce
across multiple ripeness or spoilage stages—for example: unripe, semi-ripe, ripe, overripe,
partially spoiled, and fully spoiled. Such multi-class grading is extremely valuable for post-
harvest handling, inventory management, and supply-chain decision making, where knowing the
precise stage of freshness can help reduce waste and optimize distribution. For instance, bananas
transition through multiple colour stages, and identifying the exact ripeness level is crucial for
retailers and distributors. Similarly, tomatoes, strawberries, mangoes, and apples exhibit complex
patterns of degradation that require multi-stage analysis for accurate assessment. Multi-label or
multi-task deep learning models have been proposed that combine fruit/vegetable identification
with simultaneous evaluation of ripeness levels, allowing a single system to perform multiple
quality checks at once.


para5

Another promising direction in recent studies is the development of hybrid and multi-task deep
learning systems. These models integrate CNNs with other machine learning techniques—such
as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, Transformers, or classical classifiers like
SVM—to improve precision and interpretability. Hybrid approaches are beneficial in capturing
temporal patterns in spoilage progression or associating multiple dependent outputs such as type
detection, freshness estimation, and damage localization. Some systems incorporate object
detection models such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN to locate fruit regions in cluttered scenes
before applying freshness classification, making them suitable for market or warehouse
environments where multiple items appear in the same frame. These innovations represent an
important advancement toward deploying freshness detection systems in realistic, uncontrolled
settings.



para6

Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important in this domain as well. Modern systems incorporate techniques such as Grad-CAM, Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and saliency maps to visualize the regions of an image that influence the model’s decision. Heatmaps generated through these methods highlight specific portions of the fruit or vegetable, such as mouldy areas, bruises, texture inconsistencies, or colour deformations. This provides deeper insight into the model’s internal reasoning, helping developers diagnose errors and allowing end users to trust the predictions. Transparency is particularly important in consumer-facing applications, where users may hesitate to rely solely on automated decisions regarding food quality and safety.

para7

Despite the significant progress in deep-learning-based freshness analysis, several limitations
persist in existing research. Many models are still trained and evaluated on datasets collected
under controlled studio conditions with uniform lighting, clean backgrounds, and minimal noise.
Such environments do not reflect the conditions encountered in real supermarkets, kitchens, or
farms. As a result, models that perform well in laboratory settings may struggle in practical
usage. Additionally, datasets used in most studies lack diversity in terms of fruit varieties,
spoilage patterns, maturity stages, and environmental conditions. Many research datasets include
only common fruits like apples, bananas, oranges, and tomatoes, leaving a large variety of
seasonal and regional produce unrepresented.



para8

Another major gap in current research is the absence of shelf-life prediction. While many papers
focus on classifying freshness, they rarely attempt to predict how many days a fruit or vegetable
will remain edible under different storage environments (room temperature or refrigeration).
Shelf-life estimation requires modeling both visual spoilage patterns and environmental
factors—a far more complex challenge. Nutritional analysis is also largely absent from existing
freshness detection systems. Users not only want to know if the item is fresh, but also whether it
is beneficial to consume, how many calories it contains, and what vitamins or minerals it
provides. Without such information, freshness detection systems remain incomplete from a
consumer perspective.


para9

Furthermore, many existing models are computationally heavy and require powerful GPUs for inference, making them unsuitable for deployment on mobile devices or low-resource hardware. Real-world applications—such as scanning fruits in a grocery store using a smartphone—require lightweight, optimized models capable of delivering instant predictions. This challenge remains largely unaddressed in academic literature.

para9

In contrast to these limitations, the proposed system introduces several advancements that
directly address the shortcomings found in prior studies. By predicting a continuous freshness
percentage, it offers a more intuitive and informative output than discrete class labels. The
inclusion of usable days estimation—both with and without refrigeration—adds a practical
dimension that is highly valuable for consumers, retailers, and supply-chain operators. The
integration of nutritional details and health benefits further enhances the system’s real-world
utility by supporting informed consumption decisions. Moreover, the system leverages heatmap-
based explainability to justify predictions, bridging the gap between accuracy and
interpretability. By combining deep-learning classification, explainable AI, nutritional
intelligence, and storage-based forecasting, the system achieves a level of completeness not
commonly found in prior research. The result is a highly practical, real-world-ready solution
suitable for household use, retail environments, and food-quality monitoring applications.
